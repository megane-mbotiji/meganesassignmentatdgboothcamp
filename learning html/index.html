    <h1><b>What is this?</b></h1>
    <p>This page by a <b>tweet from salma</b>.Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well,and accessible.But here we are.I'm trying my best.</p>
    <h2><b>How dose this work?</b></h2>
    <p>The key to a lot of this is leveraging using tables with a <pre>role=<q>presentation</q></pre>
        attribute to make decorated sections without css.if you view source on this page, you'll see that there are a LOT of tables.The tag typically is used to display tabular data and should NOT be used as a layout method.However,since i am not allowed to use CSS,i am pretty much exclusively relying on tables for this purpose.The presentation role tells the browser to not expose the table and its tabular children in the accessibility tree.This will make it easier to navigate for assistive technology.
    </p>
    <p>I'm also leveraging some deprcated HTML elements from HTML3.2 that you should never use. In order to be <q>compliant</q>,I've added the HTML 3.2 doctype at the top of the page: <br>This helps gives a hint to the browser we are going to use some older stuff.<br/></p>
    HOWEVER,I'm also using some newer things such as <i>details/summary,section,main,header,and footer.</i>So I'm just making a mess of my doctype and what i should be actually using!
    <h3><b>But Why?</b></h3>
    <p>I make terrible things. This was an exciting <b>nerd snipe</b>on a sunday,And I took up the challenge!</p>
